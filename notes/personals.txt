I will write , what I understood in this folder

The concept:
Origin is a blackboard;
Pull from means copying from the blackboard with pencil;
Commit means writing it down using pen;
push to means it'll be written on board.

* Always use Ctrl+Shit+P to run any cmd.
* i)   Always pull first
  ii)  Then make changes and commit
  iii) Then push

* Always staged changes are committed.
* Merge Conflict:
 i) Accept Current changes:
      Only the changes made by you are accepted.
ii) Accept Incoming changes:
      Your changes are discarded.
iii)Accept both:
      Both are accepted and the sequence given is b default.

* After accepting both the changes you can further remove, add and sequence according to   your preference.
* "+" is for staged changes-
   If you have created a number of files and are unsure of some, you can commit the sure    ones by marking them as staged changes and the rest will remain with you for further    corrections.

* Push before Pull "Error"!!

* Error detection in code becomes easier as multiple users access the code as it also   specifies the 'changes made by whom'- well I wasn't quite sure about this one, couldn't frame it properly.
